## 🛠 Core Technical Skills

### 1. Linux Administration 🐧

Linux is the foundation of most modern infrastructure and cloud platforms. A deep understanding of Linux is crucial for any DevOps role, as it forms the basis for containerization, cloud computing, and server management. Your Linux knowledge should extend beyond basic commands to include system internals, performance tuning, and troubleshooting.

#### Why Linux Mastery Matters
In the DevOps world, Linux expertise is non-negotiable because:
- Most production systems run on Linux
- Container technologies are built on Linux principles
- Automation and scripting heavily rely on Linux tools
- Performance optimization requires deep Linux knowledge
- Security implementation depends on Linux fundamentals

#### Required Knowledge Areas
